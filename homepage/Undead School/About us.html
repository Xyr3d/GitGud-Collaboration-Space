                <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-weight: bolder;"> My name is Ryan Reinhard Wangkar (王瑞安), and i am the CEO and CIO for the group
GitGud. I am responsible for submitting the work and making the documents like the
project plan, and as the leader I do my best on making sure that I can remind my team
about some work and making sure everything goes according to our plan based on
our meetings. During meetings i will always keep track of what we have discussed
and what we want to do next not only for project log and project plan but also to
remind the group in case they manage to forget about it because i want to make sure
that we are able to submit our work on time so that we don’t have much work piled
up.
